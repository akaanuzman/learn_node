### 📁 Description
Hello everyone! This is my second back-end project in software development. The project was written node.js programming langueage and with MySql Database.
Project reads and writes data (read, write, delete, add) on mysql database with ejs template engine and nodejs. Also when I was coding of the design I used Bootstrap 5.2 version. In page all of the data and all of the operations (read, write, delete, add) on website is happened from database. You can create a todo list and management this list in this project. You can add and delete a todo or todos in your list otherwise you can delete all todos from your list. I am gonna show database scheme under chapter.

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Coding
I tried to write the code of this project as clean as possible and I learned too many thing. The first one i learned to use "get" and "post" methods. The second thing i learned to database operations in nodejs. That's all I was going to tell. Thank you if you are read this text at the moment.
